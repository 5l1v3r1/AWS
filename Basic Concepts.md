AWS Basic Concepts

Region: 
Each **AWS Region** is a separate geographic area. Each **AWS Region** has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones.
Each Amazon EC2 region is designed to be completely isolated from the other Amazon EC2 regions. This achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability.

Availability Zone:
An **Availability Zone** is an isolated location inside a region. Each region is made up by several **Availability Zones**. Each **Availability Zones** belong to a single region. Also, each AZ (as **AWS** expert commonly call**Availability Zones**) is isolated, but the AZs in a region are connected through low-latency links.
