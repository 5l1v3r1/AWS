EC2 Options

On Demand: Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment. Linux instances are by the second. Windows instances are by the hour (for now).

Reserved: Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offers a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 year or 3 year terms.

Spot: Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.

Dedicated Hosts: Physical Ec2
