Open Systems Interconnection Model

The  **Open Systems Interconnection model**  (**OSI model**) is a  [conceptual model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model "Conceptual model")  that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a  [telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication "Telecommunication")  or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard protocols. The model partitions a communication system into  [abstraction layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer "Abstraction layer"). The original version of the model defined seven layers.

A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that comprise the contents of that path. Two instances at the same layer are visualized as connected by a  _horizontal_  connection in that layer.

The model is a product of the  [Open Systems Interconnection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Systems_Interconnection "Open Systems Interconnection")  project at the  [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization "International Organization for Standardization")  (ISO), maintained by the identification ISO/IEC 7498-1.
