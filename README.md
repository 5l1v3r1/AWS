**Notes and Resources for AWS**

This repository is dedicated to the Certified Developer Associate credential for AWS. The repo uses the [ACloudGuru](https://acloud.guru/dashboard) Udemy course as the source of the material.

These are the notes that I am taking as I am viewing the course. When I run into important concepts, terms, books, and other resources, they will be listed here.
